# What is an index?

An index is a mathematically determined measurement of the financial performance of a defined group of assets. Its performance is displayed as a unit-less index level.

When you invest with CryptoIndex, you do not technically "buy an index" or shares in an index. Instead, your funds are deployed to track the index as closely as possible.

# Will my portfolio performance match that of the index tracked?

Due to the effects of minimum/maximum constraints on order sizes, limits on decimal precision for order sizes and prices, fees, volatility, and other such factors, your portfolio's performance may diverge from the performance of the indexes it tracks.

This deviation is commonly known as the "tracking error".
